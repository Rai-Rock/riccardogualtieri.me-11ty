    You can usually find me on <a href="https://indieweb.social/@philhawksworth" rel="me">Mastodon</a> (I've stopped posting on <a href="https://twitter.com/philhawksworth">Twitter</a> now, but you can find <a href="/notes/">an archive of my tweets</a> on this site). 
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also sometimes find me at web development <a href="/speaking/">conferences</a>, where I might be talking about development techniques. I blog here less frequently than I'd like, but manage it a little more often on the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/">Netlify blog</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherever you find me, online or in the real world, please do come and say a friendly hello.
